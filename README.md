# ⚠ Contributions needed ⚠
Please, if you know how to fix these issues down below, feel free to make a PR, as I'm currently figuring stuff out
and don't have too much free time to fix some of these issues as quickly as I'd like.

## Stuff to fix:
- Vertex Color importing (not working for some reason)
- GFX / Col Importing for some levels like bitdw

## Stuff to implement:
- Actor importing (currently hidden from UI as it doesn't work)
